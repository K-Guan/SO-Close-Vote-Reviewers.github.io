<h1 align="center">Welcome to SOCVR!</h1>

**S**tack **O**verflow **C**lose **V**ote **R**eviewers is a [Stack Overflow chat room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq) hosting a community of users who are dedicated to improving Stack Overflow through curation of posts on the site.

Curation activities focus on improving the content of individual posts where possible, and effectively using the community curation model of Stack Overflow.

## Can we chat?

The primary purpose of the [SOCVR chat room](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers) is to have company as you use your own [moderating privileges](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges?tab=moderation) on the site. 
Working as part of a supportive team is much more enjoyable than slaving on your own.

The chat room is public; all conversations are in the open, and any Stack Overflow user who has [earned the required privilege](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/chat) can join in on the conversation.

Members are happy to help with questions about curation of Stack Overflow posts. Not sure what to do with a question or answer? Post a link and the team will take a look at it, and offer advice.

The conversation stays mainly off-topic, but is casual and quirky.
Don't fear, though - the [**be nice**](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice) policy still applies!

## ALLOWED

 - You can post a [\*-pls] request, *but* please use the following format: "[\*-pls] **REASON** post link" (\*close/reopen/delete/undelete)
   - These requests should NOT be a habit and only be used when needed
   - Please don't spam the room with requests

## NOT ALLOWED

 - Don't ask for upvotes nor for downvotes
 - Please avoid posting [oneboxes](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting); they take up valuable space

**If you have a question from any nature just ask in the chat or one of the room owners if they are around.**
